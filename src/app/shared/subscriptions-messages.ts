SWAPSHOP INFORMATION
===========================
The guidelines are;
· Things are given or swapped, or if sold should be cheap.
· Things should be taken only by those who need them for their own use (or a worthy home).
· SwapShop must NOT be advertised on social media or by any other means.
· SwapShop is only for people on the email list. Since personal information is on the 'newsletter' people should be able to TRUST that their information is kept within the group. If you want to forward a sample of the email to a suitable person you should make them aware of these guidelines first.
· The over-riding rule is to simply be mindful of the ethos and 'spirit' of SwapShop.
· Commercial entries are not allowed. However, members who run businesses may use SwapShop if they do so creatively and within the spirit of SwapShop.
Our disclaimer
· Users and their products will not be vetted, so we take no responsibility for their actions or goods.
· We reserve the right to remove any entry that seems not to fit our ethos (please don’t be offended if we do).
· We have set this up in good faith, and trust it will be used in the right spirit.
